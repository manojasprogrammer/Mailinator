# Mailinator
# I am trying to use a mailinator program to receive an email message. The very last email that was sent to mailinator
# I have registered with Mailinator.com and received an API_KEY
# Just make changes to the email and apikey and run the command prompt and you will receive your email message that was last received by mailinator.com
# The POM.xml is used for downloading the dependencies -- org.json.simple.*
